# CanvasLMS / GoogleDrive integration

Simple [LTI](http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) app for providing
google-drive integration into [CanvasLMS](http://canvaslms.com/)

Features:
- allow educators to link/embed gdrive files into course content
- allow students send gdrive files as part of assignment

## Getting Started

This app uses:
- Ruby 2.5.0 + Sinatra
- PostgreSQL 9.6
- Redis

1) Create a Google app on the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com).

2) Enable access to the Drive API for the newly created Google app

3) Create credentials for accessing the Google app
  - When asked where you will be calling the API from, select "Web server"
  - When asked what data you will be accessing, select "User data"
  - Under "Authorized Javascript origins" enter the URL where this app is deployed
  - Under "Authorized redirect URIs" enter the same URL as above, with `/google-auth/callback` at
    the end

  This will give you the OAuth2 credentials to be used in this app to access
  the Google app.

4) Go to the "Domain verification" tab and verify the domain this app is
running on.

To configure this app with your new credentials, first create your `.env` file by running `cp
.env.template .env` and then modify with your new Google credentials:

```
SESSION_SECRET=[Generate a string here with SecureRandom.hex(32)]
GOOGLE_KEY=[Your Google client ID]
GOOGLE_SECRET=[Your Google client secret]
```

Install dependencies and create the database:
```
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
```

For deploying (not development) you should also precompile assets:
`bundle exec rake assets:clean assets:precompile`

## Run

For running the server:
`ruby app.rb`

you can have an interactive console with the app configured and imported, using:
`bundle exec rake console`

## Launching from Canvas LMS

To launch the Google Drive Connector app from a Canvas instance, see this wiki:

https://github.com/learningtapestry/canvas-google-drive-connector/wiki/Configuring-the-LTI-application

## tests

uses Rspec: `bundle exec rspec`

you can check the coverage report on `coverage/index.html`
